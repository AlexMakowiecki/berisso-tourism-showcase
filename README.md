# Berisso Tourism Showcase
## What is it? 
It's a website where I aim to showcase the beauties of my current hometown, highlighting the various activities and events that tourists can experience if they come to visit.
It's also the second project, part of the Scrimba Course, that I uploaded to Github. This project is part of module 2, where they teach you the web dev basics.
## What do I use?
I use HTML, CSS, and some images
## What do I learn?
 ### Things explained but that I already knew
  * Basic HTML tags and structure
    - html, head, body, link, h1, h2, h3, p, div, img
  * class and id attribute to use with CSS
  * CSS basic properties and their functionalities
    - width, height, margin, padding, background, border, border-radius, color, font-family
  * background-image and background-size to make and modify images for the background
  * text-align:center, margin:auto to center objects horizontally
  * How to use Flexbox and its properties
    - flex-direction, align-items and justify-content
 ### Things explained that were useful to me
  * alt attribute to describe img tags, to help explain the image when it's not loading, or when a visually impaired person wants to know what it is showing in the image
  * role and aria-label attributes to help describe things to visually impaired people when there is no other attribute for it, like alt
### Why is the website too simple if I know how to make it better?
I want to only use the things that I learned in the Scrimba course, before doing the project and after completing the course, return to the projects individually, and improve them with all the things necessary for a correct website. I don't want to modify the website too much; and make it difficult to improve or fix after.
